<p> Ever thought a certain site didn't seem finished? Is your teacher making you play a boring educational game and you want to trick them into thinking your playing it by modding it?</p>

<p> Well stop dreaming and start modding!</p>
<p> Anyone can make a webmod and its very easy because if you already know this popular website coding language called javascript then you can. </br> Just make sure that you can put your code online, if not don't fear because we are allowing you to put them on our site but we still need to work on that.</p>
<p> To make a webmod just make some javascript and then save it to a ".js" file and upload it online</p>
<h1> Install instuctions </h1>
<p> To install drag the link to you bookmarks bar </p>
</br>
<a href="javascript:var mod = prompt('Mod Link', 'Paste your webmod Link here example: Website.com/mod.js the mod MUST end in .js otherwise it will not work');(function () %7Bvar script=document.createElement('script');script.src=mod;script.setAttribute('data-lang','en-US');document.body.appendChild(script);%7D());alert('WebMod loaded')"> WebMods </a>
<p>When loading a mod just press the bookmark when on the site where you want to load the mod. Paste a mods url to the text bar that comes up. "URL example: website.com/mod.js". Press ok to load the mod, then your mods will be applied.</p>
